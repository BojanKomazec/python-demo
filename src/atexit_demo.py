    # At normal program termination (for instance, if sys.exit() is called or the main moduleâ€™s execution completes),
    # all functions registered are called in last in, first out order.
    # So the output is:
    #
    # Registering atexit callback...
    # Hello Bojan from onExit2()
    # Hello from onExit()
