                "text": "So lovely to see everybody.\n\nSo early in the morning.\n\nI know it's not that early,\nbut I think you probably\n\nhad some fun last night.\n\nSo I appreciate you being here.\n\nMy name's Laurie hall.\n\nI work for clinical\nPalo Alto Networks\n\nand recently became the world's\nmarket leader in cybersecurity.\n\nWe have about 6 and 1/2\n1,000 people worldwide.\n\nWe turn over about\n$2 billion a year.\n\nWe're growing very\nfast about 30% year\n\non year growth for the\npast several years.\n\nOur mission statement is\nprotecting our digital way\n\nof life, which is a mission\nstatement that I really\n\nlike because of\ncourse, our way of life\n\nhas become very\ndigital hasn't it.\n\nThe way we meet friends,\nfamily, colleagues the way\n\nwe stay in touch the\nway we communicate.\n\nBut for me, the most\nimportant thing.\n\nAnd probably, if some of you.\n\nIt's also become\nthe way we learn.\n\nWe live and learn digitally.\n\nSo I've been working in\nsales enablement of one form\n\nor another for about 20 years.\n\nWhat for Palo Alto Networks.\n\nNow Before I was working for\nWorkday company some of you\n\nmight know before that I worked\nfor Oracle for the last 10\n\nor slightly less he has been\nworking in the tech industry.\n\nAnd I've come to\nbelieve something.\n\nSome of you may also agree that\nthe business as usual approach\n\nto sales enablement in fact,\nmost learning in most companies\n\nis basically broken.\n\nI believe we learn\nbest when we are\n\ninspired to do it not when\nwe're required to do it.\n\nBut unfortunately, we\nkeep the default setting.\n\nI guess is that\nwe often churn out\n\nlearning, which is\npretty boring ineffective\n\nand not very engaging.\n\nAnd you know no wonder often\nit has to be mandatory in order\n\nto get people to actually do it.\n\nSo I believe we need to stop\nmaking learning a chore.\n\nWe need to challenge that\nstatus quo as sales enablement\n\nleaders.\n\nWe need to try\nand make learning.\n\nBut while I believe we can make\nlearning, which is exciting\n\nand engaging and fun as\nit is outside of work.\n\nSo we need to reflect\nthe way that people\n\nlearn outside of work.\n\nAnd they have been\ndoing for some time.\n\nIt's the way that people are\nnow growing up with learning.\n\nAnd again, that's been\nhappening for a while.\n\nThis is no longer a new thing.\n\nPeople talk about the\nnew world of learning\n\nor the new world of\ndigital this digital\n\nthat it's not new is it.\n\nIt's been around\nfor a long time.\n\nAnd when you look at the way\npeople learn outside of work.\n\nYou see very quickly\nthat video has become\n\na really core part of that.\n\nSo over the past few years,\nI've been developing methods\n\nfor producing learning video\ncontent within the enterprise\n\nwithout costing the earth.\n\nSo before I get into all\nthat, let's start with why.\n\nAs Simon Sinek famously said\non Ted Talks people nodding.\n\nYou've seen the video\na video, you'll notice.\n\nHe always says,\nlet's start with why.\n\nSo his hit here goes\nhere's why I believe\n\nthat sales enablement is video\nis so important for sales\n\nenablement.\n\nThe first is scale.\n\nSo this is a map for some\nof you will be familiar\n\nnot because you've\nseen this map before,\n\nbut the situation\nwill be familiar,\n\nyou're probably already\nrealizing in most companies\n\nthat you work for\nthat you simply\n\ncan't reach all these\npeople with face\n\nto face workshops\nyou might reach,\n\nreach the people in the UK or\nin central Europe or mainland\n\nEurope.\n\nBut you're not going to\nreach all these people\n\ndown here over here.\n\nIt's just not possible.\n\nIt's when you look\nat a map like this\n\nthat the problem really\nsort of comes home\n\nand I believe video is not\nthe only way to reach people\n\nin this kind of scenario,\nbut it's certainly\n\nI believe the best way.\n\nSo we're getting\nto the point now,\n\nI think where it's frankly\nindisputable that video is\n\nthe way people prefer to learn.\n\nGiven the choice.\n\nAnd this is the important\npart in the enterprises,\n\nwhether or not, we\ngive people the choice.\n\nAnd we often don't within work\nthere isn't the opportunity\n\nto learn from video.\n\nBut for proof of\nwhy that's true.\n\nYou only have to look at\nYouTube and the numbers there\n\nspeak for themselves\nvideo content.\n\nYou've probably heard this stat\nthat says here will soon be 80%\n\n82% of internet traffic there.\n\nI think it probably already is.\n\nAnd you can learn almost\nanything on YouTube\n\nI've learned almost\neverything I've\n\nI know about video\nproduction on YouTube.\n\nI learned how to fill it a fish.\n\nI learned how to change\nthe bottom bracket\n\non my bicycle which was\nstuck from some dude in Texas\n\nsomewhere who'd posted\na video 10 years ago,\n\nI think I learned how\nto plaster a wall.\n\nPeople were impressed.\n\nSo you've probably learned\nall kinds of things on YouTube\n\nis one of the first\nthings that you\n\nfind is that when\nyou Google something\n\nyou have to find a video\nsolution to that problem.\n\nThe key point for\nme about YouTube\n\nis not just what's on YouTube.\n\nIt's the fact that every\nday thousands and thousands\n\nof YouTube are producing very\nhigh quality, very effective\n\ncontent for almost\npeanuts every day.\n\nThese guys are breaking this\nrule even in this role right.\n\nThe rule that you can't have\nit fast and cheap and good.\n\nI think you can oh,\nthese guys are doing that\n\nor at least faster and\ncheaper and good than perhaps\n\nwhat the alternative is.\n\nTed Talks is also\na great example\n\nof obviously great\nvideo learning.\n\nI'm sure all of you\nhave seen Ted Talks.\n\nWhat I love about\nTed Talks is again,\n\nit's an example of\nvideo and scale.\n\nIt's allowed Chris\nAnderson to scale.\n\nTed Talks from a virtually\nunknown private event\n\n13 years ago to a global\nphenomenon that you see now.\n\nIt might not be as\nubiquitous as YouTube.\n\nBut what I love\nabout it as well is\n\nthat it shows you a really\ngood model for how to prepare\n\nspeakers for presenting\nand how to get out\n\nhelp people to present quite\ncomplex content in a way, which\n\nis compelling concise\nand works on video.\n\nSo great example here is\nthis brain scientists lovely\n\npicture.\n\nI don't think that's a real\nbrain, but it might be.\n\nSo if she can get her.\n\nI mean, she's literally\na brain scientist\n\nif she can get her message\nacross in 20 minutes.\n\nAnyone can.\n\nIncidentally I\nlearned everything\n\nI know about public\nspeaking from Ted Talks\n\nwhich is stand here as\nproof that no practice makes\n\nno perfect.\n\nSo I don't do public\nspeaking all that often.\n\nSo what I'd like\nto do more of it.\n\nMaybe I'll get better.\n\nSo YouTube and Ted\nTalks are great examples\n\nof learning by sort of browsing\nand discovering, and exploring\n\nand I really love learning.\n\nThat way, but not\neverybody does.\n\nAnd arguably in our context,\nwe need something a bit more\n\nstructured more of a\nlearning course, a learning\n\nprogram and LinkedIn learning.\n\nI think is one of the\nbest examples is not\n\nthe only one probably one\nof the best examples of how\n\nto do that really well.\n\nAnd do it with video.\n\nIncidentally alone.\n\nI think almost everything I\nknow about color correction\n\non LinkedIn in some giving\nthese dimples because these\n\nare platforms.\n\nI actually use every single\nday myself to learn from.\n\nBut again, we need\nlook no further\n\nfor an example of how\nto take video content\n\nand how to structure\nit and deliver\n\nlearning in a formal\nmore structured way.\n\nSo with all this in\nmind a few years ago,\n\nI set myself a task\na goal to figure out\n\nhow to bring this kind of video\nlearning into the enterprise.\n\nAnd it's been a long journey.\n\nI learned a hell of a lot on\nthe way about video production,\n\ndistribution,\npromotion, and I also\n\nlearned an awful lot\nabout how not to do it,\n\nwhich is what I want to show\nyou now, because some of you\n\nmight be thinking\nsome of the same ideas\n\nand hopefully I'll show you\nwhere the bear traps are.\n\nSo to start with.\n\nI was thinking along\nthe lines of Ted Talks\n\ncover and record live events\nuse more than one camera.\n\nSo you get that sort\nof multi Cam effect.\n\nI thought, well, I'll just\ngo and buy a camcorder.\n\nYeah, it's a camcorder\nI'm sure that\n\ndo the trick should be fine.\n\nIt's got a little flippy screen.\n\nIt's a video camera.\n\nCool should be great.\n\nNot really.\n\nIt looks all right.\n\nIt's not.\n\nNo, it is terrible.\n\nIt looks terrible.\n\nAlthough you can shoot with\nthese and you can do a mode\n\nCam shoot.\n\nThey don't allow you to\nuse a microphone, which\n\nis a complete pain you have to\nthen record audio separately\n\nand it was also at this point.\n\nI learned how long it\ntakes to edit videos\n\nif you want to edit a multi\nclam clip or a multi Cam event\n\nyou need.\n\nYou can't just use\na movie or something\n\nlike that you have\nto do something\n\nlike Final Cut Pro or a similar\nprofessional application.\n\nSo I got that.\n\nI learned how to use it.\n\nThat was a very\nsteep learning curve.\n\nAnd it's come in\nuseful since then.\n\nBut even at the\nvery beginning just\n\ndipping my toe in the water.\n\nI already discovered this is\nnowhere near as simple or as\n\neasy as it looks.\n\nI then was also learning\nabout photography and video\n\nelsewhere.\n\nAnd I learned about\nthis thing, which\n\nis called the exposure\ntriangle any of you who\n\nare photographers\nor videographer\n\nwill know what\nI'm talking about.\n\nI discovered that there's\nthis thing called ISO, shutter\n\nspeed, and aperture, which are\nkind of important when it comes\n\nto exposing an image correctly.\n\nSo I got my cool little\nwhat I still thought\n\nwas a cool little video camera.\n\nI'll just figure out how\nto change the settings\n\nand you can't do that.\n\nIt's a full auto system.\n\nSame with your smartphone.\n\nSame with a GoPro or any\nother kind of action camera.\n\nYou can sometimes\nchange the settings.\n\nBut it's very, very\nfiddly they're not\n\npractical for shooting video.\n\nAnother problem with this.\n\nThese little cameras is is\nthis the sensor size is tiny.\n\nWhy does that matter.\n\nWell, if you go\nback to this image,\n\nyou can see that although the\nscreen is exposed in a way\n\nthat you can see it the rest\nof the image is too dark.\n\nIf you were then to increase\nthe exposure so that you\n\ncan see the people better the\nscreen would then be blown out.\n\nYou would get to see it at all.\n\nSo there's not\nenough dynamic range.\n\nThe camera's ability to\ncapture the bright brights\n\nin the dark darks\nis very, very poor.\n\nSo I bit the bullet.\n\nI'd already spent what I\nthought was a lot of money\n\nat the time on cameras.\n\nI seem to discover\nwhat expensive\n\nmeans in videographer.\n\nI bought this camera, which\ncost about the same as the three\n\ncameras that I was now\ngoing to put on the shelf\n\nand leave there forever.\n\nProfessional camera\nsort of it allows\n\nyou to do separate audio has\nall the settings that you\n\nneed for exposure should\ngive a great image right.\n\nI was thinking now\nI've nailed it.\n\nNot really.\n\nIt looks all right.\n\nIt's slightly better\nthan the previous one.\n\nThe problem with\nshooting events like this\n\nis that they are always\nvery high dynamic range.\n\nThis scenario in\nright now black tables\n\ndark shadows bright lights.\n\nI'm not lit very well for\nvideo effect not at all.\n\nThere's no lights on me.\n\nSo it's always going to be\ndifficult to get a good image.\n\nSo you need a camera that has\nvery, very good dynamic range.\n\nAnd again, this one\nthis one doesn't.\n\nYou're coming up against\nthe same problems\n\nwith a small sensor.\n\nIt's slightly bigger than the\nlast one but not much bigger\n\nand you can see that\nthe people I mean,\n\nactually he's\nslightly overexposed,\n\nbut he's more or less.\n\nOK But the screen is blown out\nand that the background outside\n\nis completely blown out.\n\nSo the image is not good.\n\nAnother problem\nwith these cameras\n\nis the way they\nrecord the image.\n\nSo all these cameras will say\nthat they shoot HD or they\n\nshoot for k but\nactually they don't.\n\nThey shoot HD and for\nk in black and white.\n\nBut in color they\nare actually shooting\n\nabout a quarter of that.\n\nSo if the camera\nsays it's 1080p HD\n\nis actually only\nshooting 720 in color,\n\nwhich is why the image looks\nsoft and not very good.\n\nSo I bought all this gear.\n\nI shot for a long time\nwith this gear thing.\n\nAnd I better just use it\neven though I'm not really\n\nthat happy with the image.\n\nFor about two years or a year.\n\nI shot without a shot\nsome very long events.\n\nSome onboarding programs.\n\nAnd I discovered\nthat if you going\n\nto shoot these\nkind of long events\n\nlike a week long\nonboarding program civility\n\nis going to give you\nabout 12 hours of footage.\n\nIt takes absolutely hours\nto edit that footage.\n\nSo I was getting really\nfrustrated with all\n\nof the effort and all of\nthe gear that I'd purchased\n\nand all the learning.\n\nI was doing.\n\nI was still not\ngetting anything that\n\nlooked as good as what these\nguys on YouTube were producing\n\nand it was taking me so\nlong that I was often\n\nnot able to produce videos\nin the time that I wanted to.\n\nSo it was from these\nguys that I started\n\nto learn what does work and also\nby reading more about Ted Talks\n\nand how they produced Ted talk.\n\nSo I want to show you a\nbit more about that now.\n\nSo video is scale.\n\nI'm going to talk you through\na particular use case.\n\nIt's the kind of\nTed talk scenario.\n\nThere are lots of\nother use cases,\n\nI could talk to you\nabout video, but I\n\nwant to focus on this one.\n\nThe idea of taking a live\nevent and then scaling it\n\nto recording it for viewing.\n\nI'm assuming here\nthat all of you\n\nare involved in live\nevents of some kind.\n\nAnd that at least\nin your enterprise\n\nthat you're running live events.\n\nAnd since we're doing that.\n\nThe question is kind of\nwhy reinvent the wheel.\n\nOne thing that Ted Talk\nshows us works really\n\nwell is that you can take\nan existing live event\n\nand simply capture it on video.\n\nIt doesn't interfere\nwith the events,\n\nbut you are able to then\nscale very, very quickly.\n\nThere is still some stuff.\n\nObviously, you need to\ndo to improve the event\n\nand to structure it\nwell for viewing.\n\nBut you don't have\nto do a huge amount.\n\nSo here's an example of how\nyou can take a life event\n\nand restructure it\nslightly for viewing.\n\nSo this is an example of\nan onboarding program.\n\nSo rather than just running the\nagenda as you normally would\n\nyou break it up into\n20 minute chunks.\n\nSo it becomes like a\nseries of Ted Talks\n\nwhich is fairly easy to do and\nactually the feedback we get\n\nwhen we do this is not just\nthat it works well on video,\n\nbut that it works\nbetter as a live event\n\nbecause the\nchangeover is quicker.\n\nIt's like today it's changing\nover every half an hour\n\nor so if it was any\nlonger than that.\n\nIt would be too\nmuch per session.\n\nPeople like that quick change\naround a quick turnover\n\nand it breaks the thing up.\n\nIt's a 20 minute chunk.\n\nSo actually it encourages\nthe learning designers,\n\nthe workshop delivery people\nto restructure and improve\n\nthe event itself.\n\nAnd then when it\ncomes to speakers\n\nyou then have to give\nthem some coaching\n\non how to get through their\nmessage in 20 minutes.\n\nHow to be more concise\nand more structured\n\nin order to get\nthe message across.\n\nUsually what is a shorter time.\n\nAnd often people are quite\nreceptive to that feedback\n\nwhen you tell them you're\ngoing to film them.\n\nIf you just say,\nyou know can you\n\njust please make\nyour presentation\n\nshorter people get upset.\n\nBut if you say we're doing it\nshort because we're shooting\n\non video, and\nwe're going to film\n\nyou there then are\nmuch more receptive\n\nto that kind of\ninput and feedback.\n\nSo the next part is\nthe shooting itself.\n\nAnd the key thing here\nto get this done quickly\n\nand high quality is two\nthings like switching\n\nand the camera or the\nimage quality itself.\n\nSo life switching\nis something you\n\ncan solve with one of these,\nwhich is a video Switcher.\n\nWe actually have a very similar\none working at the back today\n\nand all this does\nis it allows you\n\nto act like you're\ncontrolling a TV studio\n\nand edit the video\nas you record it.\n\nSo you have all of your cameras.\n\nLet's say you've got\nthree cameras plus you've\n\ngot the feed from the\npresentation plugged\n\ninto the switch and you simply\nswitch as the event unfolds\n\nand it allows you to capture\na live edit of what you are.\n\nYou are capturing in real\ntime, which saves you hours\n\nand hours and hours of editing.\n\nSo for a 12 hour shoot,\nwhich I mentioned earlier,\n\nyou can probably publish it\nthe same day or the same week\n\nrather than spending probably\na week or two weeks editing it.\n\nSo the time difference is\nenormous for one device,\n\nmake a huge difference.\n\nIt also allows you to live\nstream that video if you wish.\n\nSo like live TV because\nyou are switching it live.\n\nYou can then broadcast it.\n\nThat's very, very easy to do.\n\nYou just need one of\nthese little gadgets.\n\nAnd then broadcast it using\nwhatever your web conferencing\n\ntool is we you\nzoom you might use\n\nWebEx doesn't really matter.\n\nYou can do that.\n\nAnd that was very popular.\n\nWe did that with a couple\nof our onboarding programs\n\nto allow people to access it\nfrom other parts of the world.\n\nSo that switching when\nit comes to video capture\n\nyou need a better camera.\n\nSo you need a camera with.\n\nI'm going to read it someplace.\n\nI do apologize.\n\nBig sensor for\nthe dynamic range.\n\nI mentioned with sharp\nlenses fast lenses\n\noften removable lenses.\n\nSo you get a sharp image\nand clean clean image\n\nand low lights.\n\nYou need to shoot a\nwide dynamic range\n\na lot of more\nprofessional cameras\n\nallow you to shoot in what's\ncalled a low profile, which\n\ngives you much more\nof that difference\n\nbetween black and white.\n\nYou need about a\nshooting 42 color.\n\nSo you avoid the issue\nwith bad color resolution.\n\nShooting for Kia if possible,\nyou also need good sound\n\nand you also need to\nbe able to capture\n\nvideo externally onto\na video recorder that\n\nsaves the video onto an SSD.\n\nAll this sounds like overkill\nbut trust me, the time it saves\n\nis absolutely enormous.\n\nIt means that you can take\nyour SSD off the camera\n\nand start editing from\nthe SSD immediately.\n\nDon't have to mess about with\ntranscoding or converting\n\nfootage or Messing around\nwith little ss SD cards\n\nin the film and TV industry.\n\nIf you gave them that\nlesson specification\n\nthey say what they go\nyou need one of these\n\nis the Panasonic\nEva including lens\n\nwe're probably talking about\n10, 15,000 pounds or euros.\n\nOff you go, which is you\nknow pretty expensive.\n\nAnd remember, you need three\nof these for multi Cam shoot.\n\nAnd you also need to be\nable to travel with him.\n\nSo good luck getting on a\nplane with three of those,\n\nyou're going to be\nstruggling and you'll\n\nget all kinds of\ninteresting questions,\n\nalthough of course,\npeople do do that.\n\nAnd with this kind of guy\nyou probably also need a crew\n\nand for a multi Cam shoot\nperson on each camera somebody's\n\ndoing running somebody doing\nswitching somebody doing audio\n\nyou're talking Tens of thousands\nof dollars euros pounds per day\n\nto shoot an event\nlike this, which\n\njust starts to get\nprohibitively expensive\n\nand just seems ridiculous.\n\nThe good news is these days\nwith all the technology\n\nthat we see partly\ndriven by YouTube\n\nis demanding it is that you can\nget equipment like this, which\n\ngives you a very, very similar\nimage for an absolute fraction\n\nof the price has a big sensor\nas a massive choice of lenses\n\nit allows you to shoot in\nthe same color resolution\n\nwe were talking about it\ncan do good sound as log\n\nyou can record external SSD\ntotal price for that package\n\nthat you can see there, which\nis it includes an audio adapter.\n\nAnd this external recorder is\nabout three grand per camera\n\nalthough you wouldn't\nneed all of that equipment\n\non every camera.\n\nIt might still seem\nexpensive, but it's\n\na fraction of what\nit would cost to do\n\nit the normal way and the\nimportant thing with a camera\n\nlike this is that you can solve\nthis color problem you get\n\na sharp image because\nyou're avoiding\n\nthe compression shooting\nexternal recording\n\nexternally you're using\nvery, very good lenses\n\nand the camera shoots that color\nresolution internally as well.\n\nAnd if you really\nwant to go to town.\n\nYou can shoot at 4k either\nin this format or this one.\n\nAnd then downscale\nit to 1080p and you\n\nget full color,\nwhich is normally\n\nwhat you'd only get on a\nvery high end cinema camera.\n\nSo the color image\njust jumps up.\n\nSo show an example.\n\nSo there's that horrible\nimage I showed you just now\n\nwith the camcorder\nand this is what\n\nyou would see with that camera.\n\nSo it's a pretty big jump.\n\nI'm quite pleased with that.\n\nThat was two weeks ago 3,\ntwo weeks, three weeks ago\n\nin Barcelona, we had\na customer conference\n\nwhere we shot this interview.\n\nSo that's one view.\n\nIt's also important to\nnotice the nice lighting\n\nthough that does really help.\n\nSomething else\nI've been learning\n\nabout in the last\ncouple of years.\n\nHere's another angle.\n\nSo you notice in this image,\nthe extreme dynamic range\n\nthe dark dots are very\ndark and the bright lights\n\nare very bright.\n\nYou've even got\noutdoor light coming\n\nfrom the top of the image.\n\nBut the camera is\nable to capture it\n\nall, which the previous\ncamera just could not do.\n\nSo now you might be thinking\nthat even three grand\n\nfor camera sounds like a lot.\n\nAnd it is.\n\nBut there is\nanother alternative.\n\nThis is a much\nlower budget camera.\n\nIt has a large sensor\nstill but not quite\n\nas big as the previous one.\n\nThe lens is fixed\nis not as fast.\n\nIt's not a sharp\nbut it's not bad.\n\nIt can shoot lug which in this\nprice range is ridiculous.\n\nIt also shoots for\nAK 47s to color.\n\nAnd it can do good sound with an\nadapter and only cost about 800\n\nquid new.\n\nSo if you get the second\nand they're even cheaper.\n\nSo that the budget.\n\nNow is dropping,\ndropping, dropping\n\nand the image quality\nis still good.\n\nAnd we're actually using\ntwo of these cameras\n\nnow this is my colleague\nantonella with the headphones\n\non who's shooting.\n\nSo we're actually using two\ncameras right now to show you\n\nwhat that setup might look like.\n\nWe're using a simple setup here.\n\nThere's no external\nrecorders there's no Switcher\n\nbut that's not a lot\nof gear and you can see\n\nthat one person can run that.\n\nSo the cost is very, very,\nvery, very low indeed\n\ncompared to what people\nwould normally do.\n\nAnd here's an example of\nthe image you get from it.\n\nNow it's not as good as\nthe last one I showed you,\n\nbut it's not bad, right.\n\nAnd this was shot from way,\nway, way back in the room.\n\nThis was for 30 meters\naway something like that.\n\nSo this is shot at the\nmaximum extent of the zoom\n\non the camera, which\nis always where lenses\n\nstart to lose their resolution.\n\nIt was also not that well lit.\n\nSo even with that those\nconstraints the image\n\ncame out pretty well.\n\nAnd you're going to get\nthe same image resolution\n\nas a camera like this, which\nis a professional news camera.\n\nThis cost about three grand\neach including the recorder.\n\nAnd again, good luck getting\nthree of those on a plane.\n\nSo there is a way to get very\nprofessional video output\n\nwithout spending all this money.\n\nSo the next question is, what\ndo you do with this stuff\n\nonce he recorded it.\n\nSo because.\n\nBecause we've shot the\nevent on a Switcher\n\nwe can quickly publish\nit on whatever platforms\n\nwe have available.\n\nSo we generally post on Vimeo.\n\nThe advantage of that is that\nyou can host the video securely\n\non Vimeo and private.\n\nSo nobody can access it\nunless you set the setting.\n\nSo that they can.\n\nAnd then you can publish\nit anyway anywhere.\n\nSo this is kind of host\nversus post host in one place\n\nand then post wherever you want.\n\nSo we use jive.\n\nSome of my views jive it's a bit\nlong in the tooth these days.\n\nBut it's an internet platform,\nwhich a lot of people use.\n\nSo using Vimeo to\nhost, we can post on.\n\nDrive And as you\ncan see, it looks\n\nOK as a way to present\nvideo for people\n\nto browse and consume in a\nsort of exploratory fashion.\n\nThe key thing here\nis transcription\n\nsay there are\nservices online, which\n\nmake it fairly easy\nand quick to transcribe\n\npretty accurately any video.\n\nAnd then you can put\nthe transcription\n\nin the description\nof the video like so.\n\nAnd you can also add subtitles.\n\nI really like what\nhe's saying here.\n\nIt's really strange\nexcept for a presentation.\n\nBut because you're\nable to put that text\n\ninto the video\ndescription it then\n\nreally improves the\nsearch engine optimization\n\nof whatever platform\nyou're using.\n\nSo you know when\nyou search on Google\n\nfor how to fill it a fish.\n\nGoogle is giving\nreturning a result\n\nof the video because that's in\nthe transcription of the video\n\nand how that works here.\n\nUsing this approach.\n\nSo here's an example.\n\nIf I search for\nzero trust, which\n\nis the subject of\nthat video, you\n\ncan see the video\ncomes up in the list.\n\nIt might be quite\nlow down the list.\n\nBut without that transcription\nit wouldn't be there at all.\n\nSo with this approach we've\nseen this kind of growth.\n\nNow we've done almost no\nsort of deliberate promotion\n\nof video content on our internet\noccasionally here and there.\n\nBut we've seen this growth\nfrom 500 views a month\n\nto 1,500 in only in only a year.\n\nSo threefold increase just\nby using that transcription\n\nmethod.\n\nSo it has a huge\nimpact on making\n\nstuff available to people\nand allowing people\n\nto sort of stumble across it.\n\nThe other interesting\nstatistic we managed to gather.\n\nAnd this is all from\nVimeo by the way.\n\nSo Vimeo allows us to\nget this reporting, which\n\nyou couldn't get on jive so\nVimeo is another, giving you\n\nVimeo.\n\nAnother interesting\nstatistic here\n\nis that just over half\nor only half of our users\n\nare from the US.\n\nAnd you might think,\nwell, so what.\n\nWell, our population and our\ncompany is by far predominantly\n\nin the US.\n\nSo you can see that there's a\ndisproportionately low number\n\nof people from outside the\nUS using this content, which\n\nkind of backs up my hypothesis\nthat in order to reach people\n\nout there in the far\nreaches of the empire video\n\nis a really great way to do it.\n\nAnd we see a lot of people from\noutside of our core business\n\nin the US accessing this stuff.\n\nAnd I think people like it\nbecause especially if English\n\nisn't your first language\nvideo is actually a lot easier\n\nthan a live event to\nlearn from because you\n\ncan pause and stop and review a\nvideo much easier than you can\n\na real person.\n\nSo we're now getting on\nour jive internet sites\n\n12,000 hits per month because\nof this video content.\n\nAnd we 3,000 active users.\n\nNow, that doesn't\nsound like a lot\n\nif this was a YouTube\nchannel and be like.\n\nGood luck.\n\nKeep at it you\nmight get somewhere.\n\nWe only have 6 and 1/2\n1,000 people in our company.\n\nSo half the company are\nusing this regularly\n\nand roughly about that\nnumber of salespeople.\n\nSo I'm not saying that all\nthe salespeople using it.\n\nThey're not.\n\nBut we're getting\ngood engagement.\n\nWe're getting half\nthe company actively\n\nusing our content every month.\n\nSo the next question is, what\ndo you do with this content.\n\nWhat we're finding with video\nis that once you've captured it.\n\nThere are so many different\nthings you can do with it.\n\nThere's almost an argument that\nyou should video something,\n\neven if you're not\nsure what you're\n\ngoing to do with\nit later, if you\n\nthink it's valuable content.\n\nOnce you've captured\nit people come up\n\nwith all kinds of\ninteresting ideas.\n\nSo I've shown you the example\nof just posting something\n\nonline for people to\nbrowse on the internet.\n\nYou can then go the next step\nand do some more formal editing\n\nbreak it up into shorter chunks\n10 minute bit-sized pieces\n\nstart doing things\nlike translation\n\nparticularly into languages\nwhere people don't speak\n\nEnglish as a second language, or\neven a third or fourth language\n\nor they don't do it well,\nwhich really then opens up\n\naccessibility to the content\nthat you are putting out there.\n\nThe other thing we haven't tried\nyet, which I really love to try\n\nis to take an life course\nlike a live onboarding\n\nprogram and a\npresentation coming up\n\non onboarding in a\nminute and create\n\na completely online\nversion of that course,\n\nand you could do that\nby capturing video\n\nat good quality.\n\nYou can add things in like\nyou know exercises and tasks\n\nthat you want people to\ndo as part of that course,\n\nand you could do it you\nneed to put the content\n\non the Massachusetts.\n\nSo you can structure\nit, obviously.\n\nBut then you would have\nthings like tracking seeing\n\nhow people are getting on.\n\nBut that's something that\nwe were sort of touching on\n\nat the moment in our company.\n\nBut that's something\nyou could do.\n\nYou could go the whole hog\non the whole thing online.\n\nSo I want to finish with an\nexample of something we shot,\n\nwhich was a kind of end to end\nuse case example of everything\n\nI've described to you.\n\nSo this was our sales\nkickoff event in Las Vegas.\n\nWe run.\n\nWe run the event every year.\n\nLuckily we don't put it\nin Las Vegas every year.\n\nI never want to go\nthere ever again.\n\nSecond time to enough trust me.\n\nIf you've never been\nso as part of this,\n\nwe held an event\ncalled success fest\n\nwhere we had senior leaders\ninterviewing successful sales\n\nteams about their most\nsuccessful and significant\n\nsales wins of the year.\n\nAgain, the Ted Talks\napproach 20 minutes each.\n\nVery simple interview style we\ncoach the speakers in the way\n\nthat I showed you gave\nthem a clear structure\n\ngave them talking points\nand it worked pretty well.\n\nIt didn't work in\nevery single case.\n\nBut of the 24 that\nwe shot or the 24\n\nwe ran we were able to we were\nable to get almost all of them\n\nwere the quality we\nwere looking for.\n\nSo they were 24 interviews\nover the two days\n\nand we use three cameras\non each stage, the cameras\n\nthat I showed you just now the\nones we're using right now.\n\nAnd with this approach\nusing the switch\n\nwe were able to publish all of\nthose videos, the same week,\n\nwhich doesn't sound\nlike a big deal,\n\nwhether it was eight hours of\nfootage 24 times 20 minutes\n\nand we publish them all before\nwe left Las Vegas, which we\n\nnever think of that\nprobably never done that\n\nbefore publishing\nin the same week.\n\nSo using these cameras in that\nSwitcher and a very simple crew\n\nwe had two people on each stage.\n\nWe were able to do that.\n\nAnd the feedback\nwas really positive.\n\nPeople loved that\nthey could read,\n\nwatch stuff that they'd\nreally enjoyed more or less\n\nimmediately.\n\nAnd we will.\n\nAnd we also transcribed\nand translate.\n\nWe haven't translated them yet.\n\nWe've transcribed\nall the videos.\n\nThey're all as I\nshowed you before.\n\nAnd we've already used snippets\nof a lot of these videos\n\nin our more formal\nonline learning programs\n\nthat we deliver to the\ncompany worldwide to support\n\na new product launches.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo that was a quick\nsummary of what\n\nI've learned over the\nlast two or three years.\n\nThere's a lot obviously\na lot more for me\n\nto learn as a lot more\nthat you guys could learn.\n\nAnd so here's what I'd\nrecommend if you're\n\ninterested in getting started.\n\nThere are a few things\nthat you could do.\n\nYouTube is a great resource.\n\nThese for YouTube as I would\nrecommend highly particularly\n\nif you want to become a\ncamera geek but they really\n\ndo give good tips\non how to shoot\n\nand what to shoot with Jordan\nundone deep review Niger bars\n\nand disallow video shoot.\n\nThey also think not all\nof them, but most of them\n\noffer their own guides\nand training programs,\n\nwhich you can buy.\n\nThey're not expensive,\nbut they're actually\n\nreally good\nintroduction to getting\n\nstarted particularly\nby one of the cameras\n\nthat they recommend.\n\nThey then have a\nguide for that camera.\n\nThat's how they\nmake their money.\n\nBut they're excellent.\n\nThey're very, very good.\n\nAnother one is books.\n\nObviously not videos\nalthough that first one\n\nhas 14 hours of video.\n\nSo I'm allowed to\ntell you about this.\n\nThose first two are\nreally good if you'd\n\nwant to learn how to\nshoot for photos or videos\n\nand expose them correctly.\n\nThey're indispensable.\n\nThe first books are a\nbit more accessible.\n\nThe second one's\na bit more serious\n\nbut they're both\nvery, very good.\n\nThe last one is fairly\nself-explanatory\n\nwhat about books about.\n\nBut if you've learned\nhow to shoot photos\n\nor if you're already\na photographer\n\nand you want to then translate\nthose skills into videographer\n\nthen that last book is a\nreally great way to do it.\n\nAnd then Ted Talks.\n\nI didn't really talk as much\nabout Ted Talks as I'd like it.\n\nSo it's fascinating\nhow they produced that\n\nthat conference that thing.\n\nThere are two excellent\nbooks out there.\n\nYou may have read\nthem about how Ted\n\nTalks he's done, how\nthey prepare speakers.\n\nEveryone memorizes\ntheir 20 minutes speech,\n\nwhich in the real world\nis very difficult.\n\nPeople don't have\nthe time to do it.\n\nIt takes six weeks to memorize\na speech typically which\n\nI did try once and it worked.\n\nBut it was hell.\n\nI'm never doing that again.\n\nBut really, really useful tips\non structure and presentation\n\nskills not necessarily\nfor yourself.\n\nBut if you need to\ncoach other people.\n\nIf you've got a subject\nmatter expert and you\n\nneed to give them some tips.\n\nThese books are really helpful.\n\nThe other thing is my\nlink to your profile.\n\nIf you to connect\nwith me on LinkedIn\n\nI'm very, very happy\nto help anybody who\n\nwants any help tips and advice.\n\nI could talk about\nthis literally all day.\n\nYou'll be sorry actually,\nif you get in touch\n\nbecause you'll be\nlike Laura really,\n\nthat's enough for today.\n\nSo very, very happy to help.\n\nIt's become my passion.\n\nI kind of got into video almost\nby accident to solve a problem.\n\nAnd it's just become my thing.\n\nSo I'm very, very\nhappy to help anybody\n\nwho wants any tips and advice\nfrom another call email,\n\nwhatever.\n\nDon't mind.\n\nSo please don't hesitate\nto get in touch and thanks\n\nvery much for your time.\n\nWell, as there are there\nany questions for Lori.\n\nOh good point.\n\nYes any quick questions.\n\nYeah but there is a lot.\n\nAll right.\n\nWe wanted something.\n\nSo I don't have\nnumbers to back it up.\n\nBut I believe that we're so\nused to seeing very, very\n\nhigh quality content\nonline in the real world\n\nthat if you then present\npeople with something\n\nthat isn't even close to that.\n\nIt's just people are like,\nwhat the hell is this.\n\nSo yeah, I think there is\ndefinitely an expectation.\n\nIt's the same with\nsoftware and applications.\n\nYou know if you use Gmail.\n\nI mean often we use Gmail\nnow and work a few years ago,\n\nno one did.\n\nAnd we use clunky applications\nin the enterprise,\n\nwhich were nowhere\nnear as easy to use\n\nas what's outside of things\nthe same principle that we need\n\nto have the same experience,\nuser experience, learn\n\nor experience in work as\nwe do outside of work.\n\nSo I think you have qualities\nquality is much more\n\nimportant people realize in all\naspects of learning delivery\n\nnot just video one of her voice.\n\nYou could.\n\nBut the way I would do it\nwould be to take the first step\n\nis transcription.\n\nSo once you've done\nthe transcription\n\nthen getting a\ntranscription translated\n\nis not terribly\ncomplicated or expensive,\n\nbut depends on the language.\n\nSo I've done that for\nFrench I've done it\n\nfor Japanese some others.\n\nAnd then you just put that in\nthe subtitles as an option.\n\nSo you know on some YouTube\nvideos are on Netflix,\n\nyou can choose the option.\n\nSo that's how I do it.\n\nYeah The text, but\nyou could do voiceover\n\nif you wanted the\ndepends on the content.\n\nYes, you're right.\n\nBut it does work.\n\nThat's a good point because\nthe issue 1 one question\n\nis, how do you get people\nto present in a way that\n\nworks well for video having\nlots of detailed slides\n\ndoesn't work.\n\nSo I mean, if you\nnotice, I tried as much\n\nas I could not to just\ngive you lot of text\n\nkeep pictures the main thing.\n\nSo if you do that, then\nwhen you add the text.\n\nIt's not so distracting.\n\nBut you're right.\n\nI mean, if you had a use case\nwhere that was a problem.\n\nYou might consider\ndoing voiceover instead.\n\nBut then that starts to get more\nexpensive and more complicated\n\nnow the questions.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you."
